# Express JS With Node.js and TypeScript Starter

If you're also tired of having to install all the dependencies and do all the setup each time you create a Node.js Application (With or without Express) then you're in the right place.
This project aims to shorten the time it takes to do the setup. But it's EXTREMELY minimal. Which is by choice, because everyone does their things differently.

The project has the Express Essentials installed, but nothing too advanced or much.

## TypeScript Configuration, it just works.
- This Starter can directly execute .ts and .tsx files just like vanilla JavaScript, with no extra configuration.

## Future Updates:
- Adding a version of this with Bun
- Adding a version with Drizzle ORM


(The rest of the README is useless and generated by chatGPT. just run 'npm run start:dev' lol)

## Getting Started


To set up and run this project, you'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Follow these steps to get started.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local environment.
2.  Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

To start a development server with automatic reloading, run:

bash

Copy code

`npm run start:dev`

This command uses `nodemon` to watch for changes in TypeScript files and restart the server automatically.

### Building


To compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript, run:

bash

Copy code

`npm run build`

This command clears the `build` directory (using `rimraf`) and then compiles the TypeScript files into JavaScript.

### Running the Built Application
---------------

To start the built version of the application, use:

bash

Copy code

`npm run start:build`

This will run the compiled JavaScript code in the `build` directory.
