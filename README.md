  Fast & minimalist TypeScript starter projects for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

  
This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) project
which uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages.

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


## Setup - Update your dependencies.
For the project files there isn't a lot of Setup required. I've personally
made sure that all the major Setup stuff has been done. Therefore the only
thing you'd be responsible for is updating the NPM packages present in the projects.

Altough let me warn you - There might be errors or some usecases these projects wont
work with. I am not responsible for those (altough I'm open to helping out!)

The older the project gets, the more it (probably) will break. I will try to keep the
repository up to date with the newest packages and technologies but I can't for sure
say when things get updated or not.

To update the packages, follow the [Updating packages downloaded from the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/updating-packages-downloaded-from-the-registry)
guide from the official NPM website.
